# Hey!!
This is the old website for the [Clicksync Challenge List](https://cscl.shuttleapp.rs/list/), written in HTML/Javascript, hosted via Cloudflare Pages, and stolen from TSL template. As of July 10th, we have adopted a [cleaner template](https://github.com/stadust/pointercrate) used by the Demonlist, Pointercrate. The new site offers more functionality and makes the lives of the users and moderators easier. As of 7/23, the code for the new website is not public, but it hopefully will be soon. Stay tuned if you're a programmer, I'm probably gonna need all the help i can get lmao (idk rust or databases aliksdjuirthjadj).

Thanks!
